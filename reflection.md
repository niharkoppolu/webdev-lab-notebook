## Reflection Document

### HTML

Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
videos or the solutions for help?
I used the videos for the most part. I treated the exercises in 01-HTML as my notes for when I attempted the first set of homeworks.

How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?
I found all the exercises incredibly helpful when it came to teaching me the basics of HTML. Each exercise was very helpful and taught me 
the needed skills to complete homeworks 1 and 2. I would not rank one exercise above another, but perhaps exercise 04-form was the most 
difficult

Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
I think your recorded content in conjuction with the slides you provide is all the material required to learn the content necessary to 
complete these exercises along with the homeworks.

Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?
No, the exercises you gave us were sufficient.
