## Reflection Document

### HTML

I found all the exercises incredibly helpful when it came to teaching me the basics of HTML. Each exercise was very helpful and taught me
the needed skills to complete homeworks 1 and 2. I would not rank one exercise above another, but perhaps exercise 04-form was the most
difficult

I completed the week 6 exercises pretty late in the term. I felt like they weren't as relevant to the homeworks.
